# LeakyRepo Ignore File
# Files and patterns listed here will be ignored during scanning
# Supports glob patterns and directory patterns

# Example patterns:
# *.lock
# node_modules/
# vendor/
# *.min.js
# dist/
# build/

# Test files (often contain intentional high-entropy strings)
*_test.go
test_*.py

# Lock files (high entropy hashes, safe to ignore)
# package-lock.json
# yarn.lock
go.sum

# Compiled binaries (local builds, safe to ignore)
leakyrepo*
